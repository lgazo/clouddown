# CloudDOWN

A Level API (`abstract-level`) implementation on top of Cloudflare Workers KV

## Status

This is an experimental project and so far it was just used as example implementation for the Quadstore storage. The implementation is not feature complete.

Since levelup, leveldown, and levelgraph depend on some Node APIs, it need to browserify them to use.
